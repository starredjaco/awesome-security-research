## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! 🎉

Before opening a PR:

- Make sure the resource is **high quality** and focused on **security research**  
  (vuln discovery, root cause analysis, exploitation, etc. – not generic “how to hack”).
- Place it in the right section and keep the list **alphabetically sorted**.
- Prefer **original research** and deep-dive content over shallow summaries.

If you're unsure, open an issue and we can discuss it.
